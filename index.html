<h3 style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: .5ch; margin-top: 0ch; font-weight: 800;">I. DETERMINE WHAT INVENTION IS SOUGHT TO BE PATENTED</h3>


<div class="indented-section">

<ul style="padding-left: 7ch;">
  <li>Obtaining prompt yet complete examination of patent applications is essential.</li>
  <li>Under principles of compact prosecution, each claim should be reviewed for compliance with every statutory requirement for patentability</li>
  
<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
  <li>even if one or more claims are found deficient with respect to some statutory requirement.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

    <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 4.25ch; font-weight: 400;"><i>Examiners</i></p> 
  
<ul style="padding-left: 7ch;">
  <li>Examiners should:</li>
  
<ol style="padding-left: 5ch; "> 
  <li>State all reasons and bases for rejecting claims in the first Office action.</li>

  <li>Explain deficiencies clearly, particularly when they serve as a basis for rejection.</li>
  <li>Indicate how rejections may be overcome and how problems may be solved, wherever practicable.</li>
  <li>State rejections that are not based on prior art (lack of adequate written description, enablement, or utility, etc.) with full development of the reasons rather than by mere conclusion.</li>
  <li>Failure to follow the above approach can lead to unnecessary delays in prosecution of the application.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul style="padding-left: 7ch; margin-top: .25ch">
  <li>Prior to focusing on specific statutory requirements, examiners must:</li>
  
			<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
 			<li>Determine exactly what the inventor has invented and is seeking to patent, and</li>
  		<li style="margin-bottom: 1ch;">How claims relate to and define that invention.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
  		<li>Examiners will:</li>

					<ol style="padding-	left: 5ch;">
  				<li>Review the complete specification, including:
   						 <ul style="padding-left: 5ch; margin-top: .5ch;">
     					 <li>Detailed description of the invention</li>
      				 <li>Any specific embodiments disclosed</li>
      				 <li>Any specific, substantial, and credible utilities asserted for the invention</li>
     					 <li>Claims</li>
   						 </ul>
    			</li>
  				<li>After obtaining an understanding of what the applicant invented:
    						<ul style= "padding-left: 5ch; margin-top: .5ch;">
      					<li>Conduct a search of prior art</li>
     						<li>Determine if the invention as claimed complies with all statutory requirements</li>

   <ul style="padding-left: 12ch;">  
   
      <li>The applicant or the inventor is in best position to explain why an invention is useful.</li>

      <li>Accordingly, a complete disclosure should contain some indication of the practical application for the claimed invention.</li>

      <li>i.e., why applicant asserts the claimed invention is useful.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Such a statement will usually explain</li>

  <ul style= "padding-left: 12ch; margin-bottom: 1ch;">
    <li>The written description will provide the clearest explanation of the invention, by </li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch; margin-bottom: .5ch;">
      <li>exemplifying the invention,</li>
      <li>explaining how it relates to the prior art</li>

      </ul>
    </ul>  
  
  <ul style= "padding-left: 12ch; margin-top: 2ch;">
    <li>Accordingly, examiners should continue their evaluation by:</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
      <li>(A) determining the function of the invention,</li>
      <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
      <li>that is, what the invention does when used as disclosed</li>
      <li>(e.g., the functionality of a programmed computer); and</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 11.5px; margin-bottom: .5ch; font-weight: 700; padding-left: 4ch; margin-top: 1.5ch; white-space: nowrap;"><i>C. Review the Claims</i></h3>
<div style="width: 150ch; line-height: 3;">


<ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
<li>The claims define the property rights provided by a patent, and thus require careful scrutiny.</li>
<li>The goal of claim analysis is to</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch; ">
    <li>identify the boundaries of the protection sought by the applicant and to</li>
    <li>understand how the claims relate to and define what the applicant has indicated is the invention.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Examiners must first determine the scope of a claim by thoroughly analyzing the language of the claim before determining if the claim complies with each statutory requirement for patentability.</li>
<li>See In re Hiniker Co., 150 F.3d 1362, 1369, 47 USPQ2d 1523, 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1998)</li>
	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch; ">
    <li>(“[T]he name of the game is the claim.”).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>  
	
      <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;"><i>Examiner's Claim Analysis</i></p> 
    
<ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
<li>Examiners should begin claim analysis by identifying and evaluating each claim limitation.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch; ">
    <li>For processes, the claim limitations will define steps or acts to be performed.</li>
    <li>For products, the claim limitations will define discrete physical structures or materials.</li>
    <li>Product claims are claims that are directed to either machines, manufactures or compositions of matter.</li>   
    </ul>
<li>Examiners should then correlate each claim limitation to all portions of the disclosure that describe the claim limitation.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>This is to be done in all cases, regardless of whether the claimed invention is defined using means- (or step-) plus- function language.</li>
    <li>The correlation step will ensure that examiners correctly interpret each claim limitation in light of the specification.</li>
    </ul>
</ul> 

   <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;"><i>Claim Scope</i></p> 
 
<ul style= "padding-left: 12ch; ">
<li>The subject matter of a properly construed claim is defined by the terms that limit the scope of the claim when given their broadest reasonable interpretation.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>It is this subject matter that must be examined.</li>
    </ul>
<li>As a general matter, grammar and the plain meaning of terms as understood by one having ordinary skill in the art used in a claim will dictate whether, and to what extent, the language limits the claim scope.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>See MPEP § 2111.01 for more information on the plain meaning of claim language.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Language that suggests or makes a feature or step optional but does not require that feature or step does not limit the scope of a claim under the broadest reasonable claim interpretation.</li>
<li>The following types of claim language may raise a question as to its limiting effect:</li>
	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>(A) statements of intended use or field of use, including statements of purpose or intended use in the preamble,</li>
    <li>(B) “adapted to” or “adapted for” clauses,</li>
    <li>(C) "wherein" or "whereby" clauses,</li>
    <li>(D) contingent limitations,</li>
    <li>(E) printed matter, or</li>
    <li>(F) terms with associated functional language.</li>
    <li>This list of examples is not intended to be exhaustive</li>
    </ul>
<li>The determination of whether particular language is a limitation in a claim depends on the specific facts of the case.</li>
	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
	<li>See, e.g., Griffin v. Bertina, 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002)</li>
		<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    	<li>(finding that a “wherein” clause limited a process claim where the clause gave “meaning and purpose to the manipulative steps”)</li>
   		</ul>
    </ul>
<li>For more information about these types of claim language and how to determine whether they have a limiting effect on claim scope, see MPEP §§ 2111.02 through 2111.05.</li>
</ul> 
    
        <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;"><i>Examiner's Claim Analysis</i></p>
      
<ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
<li>Examiners are to give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the supporting disclosure.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>See MPEP § 2111.</li>
    <li>Disclosure may be express, implicit, or inherent.</li> 
    </ul>
<li>Examiners are to give claimed means- (or step-) plus- function limitations their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with all corresponding structures (or materials or acts) described in the specification and their equivalents.</li>
    <ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>See In re Aoyama, 656 F.3d 1293, 1297, 99 USPQ2d 1936, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</li>
    <li>Further guidance in interpreting the scope of equivalents is provided in MPEP §§ 2181 through 2186.</li>
    </ul>
<li>While it is appropriate to use the specification to determine what applicant intends a term to mean, a positive limitation from the specification cannot be read into a claim that does not itself impose that limitation.</li>
	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>See MPEP § 2111.01, subsection II.</li>
    </ul>
<li>As explained in MPEP § 2111, giving a claim its broadest reasonable interpretation during prosecution will reduce the possibility that the claim, when issued, will be interpreted more broadly than is justified.</li>
<li>Finally, when evaluating the scope of a claim, every limitation in the claim must be considered.</li>
<li>Examiners may not dissect a claimed invention into discrete elements and then evaluate the elements in isolation.</li>
	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>Instead, the claim as a whole must be considered.</li>
    <li>See, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 188-89, 209 USPQ 1, 9 (1981)</li>
    	<ul style = "padding-left: 5ch;">
    	<li>(“In determining the eligibility of respondents’ claimed process for patent protection under § 101, their claims must be considered as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis. This is particularly true in a process claim because a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made.”).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: .5ch; margin-top: 0ch; font-weight: 800;">II. CONDUCT A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PRIOR ART</h3>
<ul style="padding-left: 7ch;">
<li>Prior to evaluating the claimed invention for patentability, examiners are expected to conduct a thorough search of the prior art.</li>
    <ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
    <li>See MPEP §§ 904 through 904.03 for more information about how to conduct a search.</li>
    </ul>
<li>In many cases, the result of such a search will contribute to examiners' understanding of the invention.</li>
<li>Both claimed and unclaimed aspects of the invention described in the specification should be searched if there is a reasonable expectation that the unclaimed aspects may be later claimed.</li>
<li>A search must take into account any structure or material described in the specification and its equivalents which correspond to the claimed means-(or step-) plus-function limitation, in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112(f) and MPEP § 2181 through MPEP § 2186.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: .5ch; margin-top: 0ch; font-weight: 800;">III. DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMED INVENTION COMPLIES WITH 35 U.S.C. 101</h3>

  <h4 style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: .5ch; font-weight: 800; padding-left: 4ch;"><i>A. Consider the Breadth of 35 U.S.C. 101 Under Controlling Law</i></h4>

  <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;">Section 101 of title 35, United States Code</p>
  <ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
  <li>Section 101 of title 35, United States Code, provides:</li>
	<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
        <li>"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title."</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;">35 U.S.C. 101 requirements:</p>
  <ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
  <li>35 U.S.C. 101 has been interpreted as imposing four requirements:</li>
	<ol style="padding-left: 5ch;">
        <li>(i) only one patent may be obtained for an invention;</li>
        <li>(ii) the inventor(s) must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012, or must be the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012;</li>
        <li>(iii) the claimed invention must be eligible for patenting; and</li>
        <li>(iv) the claimed invention must be useful (have utility).</li>
        </ol>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-size:11px; font-family: Roboto Flex,sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0ch; margin-top: -.5ch; padding-left: 8ch; font-weight: 400;">35 U.S.C. 101 threshold inquiry</p>
  <ul style= "padding-left: 12ch;">
  <li>**The patent eligibility inquiry under 35 U.S.C. 101 is a threshold inquiry.</li> 
  <li>Even if a claimed invention qualifies as eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101, it must also satisfy the other conditions and requirements of the patent laws, including the requirements for</li>
	<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
        <li>novelty (35 U.S.C. 102),</li>
        <li>nonobviousness (35 U.S.C. 103),</li>
        <li>and adequate description and definite claiming (35 U.S.C. 112).</li>
        <li>Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 602, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1006 (2010).</li>
        </ul>
  <li>Therefore, examiners should</li>
	<ul style="padding-left: 5ch;">
        <li>avoid focusing on only issues of patent-eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101 to the detriment of considering an application for compliance with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 102, 35 U.S.C. 103, and 35 U.S.C. 112,</li>
        <li>and should avoid treating an application solely on the basis of patent-eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101 except in the most extreme cases.</li>
